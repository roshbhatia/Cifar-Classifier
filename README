This is a small CNN that attempts to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset!

To run please ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:
	numpy
	tensorflow
	itertools
	matplotlib

To run, just type in "python3 cifar_classifier.py"
	I use the "-u" flag personally because it takes a while to run!

The program also outputs a small graph of training and validation accuracy per epoch.

You should have around 70% accuracy with this as of 2018-04-27
